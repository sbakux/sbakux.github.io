	<h1>Impact driven Design<span> - a manifesto for designers</span></h1>
</section>

<section>
	<article class="col--1">


<p class="weight--500 color--gray margin--none">The following statements are distilled from my values not only in design, but as a human being. They are meant as a guide to think about design, culture, and to make human-centred decisions. They are a waypoint and a daily reminder on to approach everything from service visions, collaboration, product design, to the people experiencing the products we put into the world.</p>
 

			
	<h2 class="weight--500">We are here to understand problems</h1>

<p>When we hear problem, we don’t think solution, we think of understanding the problem at hand, as design is not about producing things, but about problem solving. 
Once we reach an understanding of user or business needs through our tools and methods, several solutions may offer itself on the path to creating products and experience that are both useful and meaningful. </p>


	<h2 class="weight--500">We work to break down silos</h2>

<p>It is paramount to us that design itself does not become a silo. Service design is essential to understanding overall product visions and guiding organisational change, but to have as great an impact as possible. Therefore designers at are always pro-active in their collaboration and commit to teaching service design thinking in our partnerships in order to deepen the value we create.
 
 

	<h2 class="weight--500">One size does not fit all</h2>


<p>We see the individuals and context before using any tools. Being truly inclusive means being agnostic about the methods we employ. We respond well to change, and are adaptive in our approaches, where we do not stick with certain methods if they are not applicable to fit an individual need orreach a better understanding of the challenges at hand. 
 

	<h2 class="weight--500">Sharing is caring</h2>

<p>As individuals and designers, we share to evolve. We pick each other’s minds and welcome feedback and critique as much as possible. We are not all alike, but we thrive in our differences, and together we always reach a better idea or a fresh take on a challenge.


	<h2 class="weight--500">We design with insights, not assumptions</h2>
<p>Proper user research is not a bottleneck in agile development. We invest in good user research in order to inform good UX design. We don’t assume user behaviour, instead we are informed by data and analytics. The research evidence we create can be used to support any design decisions or artefacts and will only become more essential as a design system expands. Therefore, doing good design research not only means a more meaningful end product, it increases the efficiency of the overall development cycle. Understanding core mental models creates a focus that saves time and exposes assumptions not yet understood and key areas in need of further validation. 


	<h2 class="weight--500">We test as early and often as possible</h2>
<p>Whether through simple paper prototypes or advanced digital ones, we test whenever we’re in need of validation. This can happen as a structured usability testing or guerrilla testing. We set metrics for our products and analyse the performance. Whatever is needed, we test and we respond accordingly to make the best long-term decisions. We are fond of killing our darlings and having a prototyping and testing approach firmly integrated into our product development cycle benefits the entire project. 



	<h2 class="weight--500">We look at the world around us</h2>
<p>We’re a curious bunch and we strive to be as knowledgeable as possible. Whether we’re looking at interaction design, visual design or concepts for products, we know that in order to innovate you simply have to look around the world and seek knowledge instead of trying to invent and learn everything from scratch. We combine ideas, we explore things we otherwise wouldn’t, we have several solutions to a problem, which helps us see what will and won’t work and how to evolve from there. Standing on the shoulders of giants and looking to those who came before us is often the best way to look ahead.
 

	<h2 class="weight--500">We take ownership</h2>
<p>We enable innovation and business value by fostering a strong partnership where we keep overview. From facilitating the early discovery phase of a project all the way to the final stages of delivery, designers are committed to providing a clear view on the strategy of overall product. We balance an understanding throughout the iterative cycles of the project to deliver meaningful solutions where business, design and technology is all taken into consideration.  


	<h2 class="weight--500">We put the ‘design’ in service design</h2>
<p>While we employ many tools of understanding problems and business cases, we always remember to create beautiful and intuitive designs. We believe that great design understands and empowers users to achieve meaningful tasks, but without visual design there is no tangible outcome.
 


	<h2 class="weight--500">Sustainable</h2>
<p>Not only do we build a strong collaboration and relationship in our partnerships, the same goes for the products we ship. We invest in our products as we invest in our skills, we never stop looking for opportunities and we continually have an ambition to scale sustainably. Curiously revisiting our own work and seeing what could have been better is how we improve as designers.</p>
