Empowering the Energy Sector
Navigating the Trilemma with Service Design

Setting the stage

The energy market stands apart from other business sectors due to its critical importance to society. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently said in an interview that he thinks “Compute will be the currency of the future”, implicitly emphasizing how energy is the backbone of modern life – powering industries, transportation, homes, and essential services. This societal dependence means decisions in the energy sector have far-reaching consequences. Energy companies must balance the need for immediate, reliable energy with the long-term imperative of transitioning to sustainable sources, all while navigating complex regulatory frameworks and geopolitical risks (Helm, 2022).
Unlike fast-moving consumer markets, energy infrastructure projects require enormous capital investments that necessitate decades-long planning cycles. This means companies must be acutely aware of emerging trends and make informed decisions that align with both near-term needs and the shift toward renewable energy. 
And as traditional energy companies shift from the predictable, one-directional market of yesterday to the volatile, decentralized, bi-directional, service-based market of the future, they encounter unparalleled obstacles in areas ranging from new business models and internal operations to regulatory complexity, renewable energy integration, and the untangling of digital legacy landscapes.
Moreover, the war in Ukraine has thrown a spotlight on the energy sector's vulnerabilities. It underscored the urgent need to diversify energy sources and build resilience. The industry now faces additional pressure in meeting global energy demands while simultaneously alleviating the societal impacts of these disruptions.
While the challenges and urgency are well known, effective solutions are hard to come by. This article examines how service design, with its focus on strategic frameworks and risk reduction, acts as a bridge builder, equipping traditional energy companies to identify overlooked opportunities and develop solutions to overcome the challenges they face. Articles about design often have a focus on the B2C consumer experiences, while the major transformative impact for the planet sits in tackling the challenges of the large energy-consuming industries in the B2B area. And here, the energy sector has historically focused on optimizing technical systems, often neglecting the human in the loop. Service design, however, offers a systematic approach for navigating the complexities of existing legacy systems to new business models. This isn't just about the interaction between company and customer; it encompasses the whole energy ecosystem – industry partners, policymakers, employees, and environmental impact. 
While pockets within the energy sector recognize the value of service design, widespread trust in its transformative potential remains limited. This article aims to bridge that gap by demonstrating how service design offers a strategic framework for addressing some of the core challenges of the energy trilemma: ensuring energy security, affordability, and environmental sustainability.
We'll delve into practical applications of service design for traditional energy companies. This includes navigating operational complexities surrounding legacy infrastructure, overcoming a commodity-driven mindset, and fostering trust through evidence-based solutions that mitigate uncertainties during transformation.
This marks a holistic shift towards service-focused organizations supplying people-centric solutions that propel the industry into a sustainable future. To fully grasp the role of service design within this transformation, let's first explore the fundamental concept behind the energy trilemma.
The Invisible Hands of Energy
In my early university days, I studied how people experience and perceive the world around them - a field known as phenomenology. Among the thinkers who left a lasting impression was Maurice Merleau-Ponty. His concept of "intertwined existence," laid out in his groundbreaking work 'The Visible and the Invisible’, painted a picture of our world not as a collection of separate entities, but as a complex dance of influence. Our actions, often with unseen consequences, shape the world around us, just as the world shapes our very experiences.
Fast forward to years later, and me working in a completely different field as Head of Design for the digital arm of Shell Renewables & Energy Solutions, this concept unexpectedly resurfaced as a helpful lens to view the challenges faced by the energy industry. On February 22nd, 2022, I was conducting a series of workshops in London on Shell's digital strategy for the coming year. But this morning the news was dominated by the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, casting a long shadow over our discussions and rapidly impacting plans. This event sadly highlighted the critical need to achieve a balance between energy security, sustainability, and affordability, but also showcased the challenge for large energy majors to rapidly adapt to new circumstances.
A dangerous Dance 
The energy trilemma presents a complex balancing act for the energy sector. It grapples with ensuring a stable and reliable energy supply (security), minimizing environmental impact (sustainability), and keeping costs affordable. These three priorities are constantly at odds, with progress in one area often coming at the expense of another.
Traditional approaches to energy often operate in silos, optimizing for one aspect of the trilemma while potentially neglecting others. This can lead to a proliferation of point solutions that address immediate needs but lack cohesion and create a sprawling brownfield landscape of outdated technologies. Enter Service Design with its focus on connections, interdependencies, and opportunities. Unlike delivery-focused approaches that might prioritize rapid output, service design brings an emphasis on evidence and dependencies - in essence “slowing down to speed up” development in the long run. This ensures that the vast resources and engineering talent within the sector are working towards solutions with clear purpose and value. Furthermore, service design helps to avoid the accumulation of tech debt – a hidden cost associated with poorly designed and implemented digital solutions. By taking a user-centric approach and focusing on long-term value, service design ensures that digital development supports the overall strategic goals of the energy sector.
For many consumers, affordable energy is a basic necessity. However, keeping energy costs low can come at the expense of environmental sustainability, as cheaper options may rely on polluting sources. This creates a double bind – prioritizing affordability can limit our ability to invest in cleaner, but often more expensive, renewable energy sources. Affordability depends on a mix of market dynamics, regulatory hurdles and technological advancements.To ensure digital solutions are both desirable and create genuine impact, the IDEO framework of desirability, viability, and feasibility (DVF) is often employed. By collaborating with product, business, and engineering teams, service design facilitates the DVF lens to explore new revenue models, such as energy efficiency subscriptions, moving beyond a sole focus on selling fuel units. Additionally, service design's mapping of processes and stakeholder relationships offers strategic insights. This allows energy companies to strategically introduce digital innovations into existing infrastructure, maximizing success while avoiding costly overhauls.This risk-mitigating approach likely temper some of the hype around emerging energy technologies, where iterative cycles of testing and research steps in to help energy companies navigate hype cycles, focusing on solutions with proven viability to make informed investments.
Within Shell this has in pockets been tackled through processes that ensures that incoming demand for digital development is taken through stage gates that seeks to provide appropriate evidence for moving forward, while facilitating collaboration and understanding dependencies in between relevant silos.  






Tackling the demands of heavy industry
As mentioned, the B2B energy sector holds the key to the energy transition and for industries like cement, steel, and large-scale manufacturing, this presents a unique set of difficulties. These businesses are inherently energy-intensive, with core processes that require significant energy input, making significant emissions reduction a major hurdle. Existing production technologies might not be easily adaptable to cleaner alternatives, and research and development for new, low-carbon processes requires substantial investment. Even if cleaner technologies are identified, businesses need to balance environmental goals with the very real pressure to remain competitive. Transitioning to cleaner energy sources or implementing carbon capture technologies can be expensive, and passing on those costs to consumers can erode market share. To add to this, many large energy providers grapple with "brownfield digital landscapes" – complex IT systems built and layered over time. These legacy systems can be cumbersome and inefficient, hindering data analysis and hindering the adoption of new technology
When Solutions Create Problems
The energy sector thrives on a foundation of reliability and consistent service – a crucial necessity in a world so reliant on power. This emphasis on stability, however, creates unique obstacles in the transition toward a more sustainable and innovative energy future.
One key challenge facing many energy companies today is the "commodity mindset."  Traditional energy companies have often functioned on a model that emphasizes selling quantifiable units of energy (e.g., kilowatt-hours, barrels of oil). While necessary, this singular focus can stifle the development of broader, customer-centric service solutions needed to meet the demands of a changing market.
Additionally, power plants, distribution networks, and internal business systems within many energy companies were designed for a different technological era. These legacy infrastructure constraints can make them inflexible, lacking in modern data analysis capabilities. This makes adapting to a rapidly evolving energy landscape difficult, often leading to slower adoption of renewable technologies and a general hesitancy towards embracing disruptive innovations.
The pace of change in energy technologies like solar power, battery storage, and smart grid solutions is another hurdle. For traditional energy companies with long-term investment cycles and more rigid structures, deciding which innovations hold true potential and which are merely fads becomes a major obstacle.
Case Study: Octopus Energy
Octopus Energy serves as an example of a company challenging these barriers. Their Kraken platform (a cloud-based energy management system) demonstrates how innovative service design can unlock powerful benefits, even within a legacy environment.  The Kraken platform enables flexible pricing models, allowing customers to tap into cheaper energy during less busy periods. It enhances customer interaction, building trust through more transparent offerings, and seamlessly incorporates renewable energy sources into the grid, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Practical Applications of Service Design in the Energy Sector

Operational Efficiency
Service design isn't just about the customer-facing experience; it can transform internal operations too. By carefully mapping out processes across the energy company, from billing and customer service to grid maintenance, inefficiencies and bottlenecks can be exposed. Rethinking these workflows doesn't just improve the company's bottom line; it directly impacts customer satisfaction by reducing issues like long wait times or inaccurate bills. This smoother experience also boosts employee morale, as their own jobs become less focused on mitigating problems and more focused on delivering proactive services.
New Business Models
The shift away from fossil fuels requires energy companies to break free from the traditional mindset of simply selling units of energy. Service design pushes for value creation. Instead of selling kilowatt-hours, companies can offer packages for in-depth energy efficiency audits, complete with consultations and financing options for upgrades. They could bundle smart home devices with the focus on optimization, allowing customers direct control over their usage. Or, consider subscription plans that move risk away from the consumer by focusing on performance guarantees – a home at a comfortable temperature for a set monthly price. These models create a much deeper connection between energy providers and their customers.
Building Trust
The energy trilemma impacts all of society. Affordability, sustainability, and evolving energy needs are no longer niche concerns. Service design principles can promote transparency through clear communication of energy data and solutions-based approaches that are easy for the public to understand.  Engaging with communities through design thinking workshops opens up channels for customers to voice concerns and co-create solutions. This builds a sense of shared responsibility and trust between utilities and their customers.

Case Study: Kaluza
Kaluza, with its focus on intelligent energy solutions, exemplifies how applying service design principles can benefit everyone involved. Their Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology allows electric vehicle owners to sell excess stored energy back into the grid during peak demand. This benefits the grid by providing stability (sustainability), reduces costs for the company, and puts extra income in the hands of EV owners (affordability). Kaluza demonstrates the power of service design – transforming energy companies from mere suppliers into collaborative partners working with customers to solve larger energy challenges.

Reimagining Operating Models for Agility and Resilience
Blueprinting for Transparency: Service blueprinting, a core service design tool, visually maps out all the interactions and touchpoints involved in a process (including those invisible to the customer). This is exceptionally valuable for B2B, where complex behind-the-scenes operations directly affect the client experience. Blueprinting makes it easier to spot optimization opportunities and fosters collaboration between different teams involved in delivering a service.
Data as a Design Material: Service design treats data as an essential element in designing better solutions. For B2B energy contexts, this means focusing on data flows between the company and its industrial clients. Consider: What data does the client need to optimize their energy usage? How can it be delivered in a clear and actionable format (dashboards, customized reports)? Conversely, what data does the energy company need to best serve their clients?
Employee Experience (EX) is Key: In B2B services, employees who interact with clients are a crucial touchpoint. Service design principles can optimize these interactions. Tools like journey maps from the employee's perspective can identify pain points in their processes (like outdated customer data), empowering them to offer better service.
Case Study Revision: Adjust the Vattenfall example to highlight B2B potential. Perhaps their complex legacy systems pose a major issue not only for individual customers but also for their large industrial clients who need detailed, accurate data for their own sustainability reporting. The redesigned process could address this B2B pain point specifically.


Chapter Title: Reimagining Operating Models for Agility and Resilience
Legacy Systems: Enemy of Innovation
Traditional energy companies often rely on operating models built over decades. While stability is crucial in this sector, these outdated systems often create silos, slow decision-making, and hinder the ability to integrate cutting-edge technologies needed for the energy transition. Rigid workflows, disconnected data sources, and overly complex processes built on legacy IT infrastructure form a barrier between an energy company and the rapidly changing market it needs to navigate.
Service Design Meets Operations
Service design isn't just about the customer experience. By applying its lens internally, it can transform operations for improved efficiency and adaptability:
Process Mapping: Detailed mapping of existing processes, from customer service inquiries to maintenance of power plants, exposes bottlenecks, redundancies, and pain points for employees. This creates tangible starting points for optimization.
User-Focused Workflows: Redesigning these processes with employees, as the users, at the center creates smoother, more intuitive workflows. This not only saves time but boosts morale by removing unnecessary friction from daily work.
Modular and Adaptable Models: Service design helps break down operating models into smaller, interconnected components. This allows companies to adapt more easily as technologies, regulations, or customer demands shift. Think of it as building with adaptable blocks instead of a rigid structure.
Data Everywhere: Service design champions data integration across silos. This enables real-time insights into operational efficiency, helping identify issues early and empowering teams to proactively address them.

Case Study: Shell
A major energy company like Shell might face issues with slow and error-prone billing processes due to a mix of outdated and incompatible software. A service design intervention maps the entire billing journey from meter readings to invoice generation. It finds that manual data transfers between systems and unclear customer communication channels are root problems. The redesigned process could include automated meter data integration, user-friendly customer portals for managing payments, and proactive notifications with clear explanations of charges. These streamline the process for both customers and Shell, reducing operational costs and increasing customer satisfaction.

Chapter Title: Beyond the Kilowatt-Hour: New Business Models for the Energy Transition
The Shift from Units to Solutions
Historically, energy companies focused on selling a measurable commodity – a kilowatt-hour of electricity or a barrel of oil. Service design pushes them to think holistically. Instead of just energy, companies should consider themselves to be in the business of enabling customers to achieve their goals (a comfortable home, a productive manufacturing process, a sustainably powered business) in ways that promote the energy transition.
Service Design Toolkit for Business Model Innovation
Here's how service design drives new business models:
Empathy-Driven Hypothesis: In-depth research with customers uncovers unmet needs or pain points that traditional offerings don't solve. These become the seeds for innovative models. Service design teams might investigate why a small factory struggles with energy costs and identify that they lack expertise to optimize consumption patterns.
Business Model Canvas: This tool aids in breaking down components of a new model (revenue streams, value proposition, etc.) It is used collaboratively with stakeholders from sales, operations, and finance.
Rapid Prototyping and Testing: Service design advocates for small-scale, low-risk pilots of new models. This could be a performance-based subscription offered to a select group of businesses before a full launch. Data and feedback are gathered to refine the model before wider rollout, minimizing risk.
Examples of Emerging Business Models
Performance-Based Subscriptions: Energy companies could offer plans based on guaranteed indoor temperature ranges, with smart technology ensuring efficiency is achieved on their end. This shifts risk away from the consumer.
Energy as a Service (EaaS): An industrial client could pay for the output of lighting on their factory floor rather than buying bulbs and electricity. This model incentivizes the energy provider to install the most efficient and durable solutions for long-term benefits.
Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading: Service design helps create user-friendly platforms connecting homes and businesses with excess solar generation to their neighbors, reducing grid reliance. Blockchain technology and clear pricing structures are core elements of these models.
Overcoming Barriers: Regulations and Legacy Mindsets
Service design aids in navigating these complexities through co-creation workshops with regulators to showcase the benefits of new models or iterative launches that gather data to mitigate concerns about untested models with key stakeholders.
