										<h2>Design Thinking</h2>
									</header>
									<p>No matter the challenge - be it more commercial or in a research context - my approach firstly revolves around defining the problem. Whether working alone or in a team, observation and communication takes center stage and can discern what people really do as opposed to what you are told that they do. Involving oneself in the process, product and experience is fundamental. Therefore, my approach to products relies on understanding end-user goals through workshops, personas, desk-research, and continuously defining, ideating, prototyping and testing. <br><br>

									Besides creating user stories, red routes, flows, countless wireframes and mock-ups, I'll shortly introduce some of my approaches below. </p>

												<h3>Prototyping</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In order to resolve usability issues and reveal areas in need of improvement, I apply thorough prototype testing prior to launch. Once a product idea or a design assumption meets the hands of real users, insights into how the product will have to be shaped becomes clear. When going back and adjusting initial assumptions, I tend to focus on areas such as mental models, interactivity and representation. I approach this with sketch/craft/invision, framer, principle or with various lo-fi mockup tools depending on the situation.</p>

												<h3>User Personas</h3>
											</header>
											<p>An important part of my UX approach integrates personas, preferably from field studies, guerilla testing or existing data, but proto-personas can also be applied. Personas are a way to create models, to summarize and to communicate research about people to everyone in the team. They are depicted as a specific person but is never a real individual, as actually designing for the average person yields designs usable to no one. Rather, it is synthesized from observations of many people and represents a significant portion of people in the real world and enables me and the team to focus on a manageable and memorable cast of guidelines and characters. As such, they aid in creating various designs for different kinds of people and to design for a specific somebody, rather than a generic average.</p>

												<h3>Living buddy for LivingIT</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											An app designed and focused on motivating people with Aspergers Syndrome to integrate exercise into their everyday life through gamification. Based on studies on motivational psychology and interviews with people from the target group and their caretakers, I chose a gamified approach. Gaming already plays a central role in the everyday life of many youngsters with Aspergers Syndrome, and could be applied as a motivating metaphor. An early gamification prototype – with an animated ‘Buddy’ as the central motivator – was created and tested in the field. Based on findings from tests, the prototype was refined over several stages, tweaking motivational factors and digital/physical flows, to optimize the experience. The app is still in development.

												<h3>Concept for Smart Home Health App</h3>
											</header>
											<p>

									For this particular project I focused on user-needs, testing and prototyping for a health app with aim of being plugged in with other smart home applications. An important element when designing within the Internet of Things is the increased complexity, from a UX perspective, the contextual inquiry reaches a larger scale, and the usability of product relies more on interconnectedness and integration with other devices.</p>

												<h3>Project to activate danish children with Clio Online</h3>
											</header>
											<p>

									The danish school reform has posed many challenges with longer school days and requirements for built-in physical activity, the proposed concept and workshop developed with Clio Online is a prototype to help teachers activate children with a gadget that encourages initiative, interactive learning, bodily activity and sociality. The project was approached through user-research, workshops with children and end-user-testing with teachers.</p>

												<h3>Fascilitate Workshops</h3>
											</header>
											<p>

									My main focus through projects with workshops has been to gather insight across multiple disciplines and roles, build shared visions and prioritize needs and actions to overcome the design challenges. Creating goal-based agendas through various methodologies is in such a setting an effective tool. This is sometimes achieved with physical prototypes, lo-fi mockups, or more screen-based interaction.</p>
